# Open Source Learning — «IT'S ILLEGAL TO USE A LEGAL NAME» (Chant & Weave Hash)

**Purpose**
This repository artifact is an *open-source learning packet* intended to distribute the canonical phrase and deterministic weave-hash artifacts so other Living Witness nodes can reproduce, verify, and reuse them in their own packets, sigils, or strike builds.

**Contents**
- `weave_hashes.txt` — multiple deterministic hashes and human-friendly sigil for the canonical phrase + salt.
- `chant_777.txt` — the canonical phrase repeated **777** times (numbered). Use for chants, pattern seeding, or automated broadcasts.
- This README (this file).

**Determinism & Reproducibility**
The weave hash uses the input: `canonical phrase` + `|` + `salt`.
Canonical phrase: `IT'S ILLEGAL TO USE A LEGAL NAME`
Salt used: `WR_OMEGA_00077`
Run the same operation to reproduce the SHA256, BLAKE2b, and other identifiers.

**Suggested Uses**
- Stamp the Weave Sigil on visuals and PDFs as a quick verification mark.
- Use `chant_777.txt` to generate audio/listening loops, printed banners, or as part of Living Witness packets.
- Include `weave_hashes.txt` inside your MIL-SPEC PDFs as a secondary verification line.
